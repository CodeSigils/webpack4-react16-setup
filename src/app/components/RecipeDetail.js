    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 (18.25 ounce) package devil s food cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ®)
      </li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages prepared vanilla frosting</li>
      <li>1 (7 ounce) pouch prepared chocolate frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin
        tins with paper liners, preferable dark-colored or Halloween-themed
        ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an
        electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at
        medium speed until batter is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Spoon
        batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
        comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes. Remove from oven and cool tins on a
        wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the tins and cool
        completely on a wire rack before decorating, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frost each cupcake with a thin layer of white vanilla frosting and
        refrigerate for 30 minutes to make decorating easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cupcakes from fridge and apply a second layer of white frosting.
        Fill a piping bag outfitted with a small round tip with chocolate
        frosting and draw a skull face on the cupcakes: pipe large ovals for the
        eyes, two dots for the nostrils, and a large stitched smile for the
        mouth.
      </li>
    </ol>
